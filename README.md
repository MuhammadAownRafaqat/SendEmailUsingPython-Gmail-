# SendEmailUsingPython-Gmail-
A cool and very simple email sending software to send emails with gmail using python.

**Important:** Before your run this code, first create a folder and put all the files inside it, so that you can avoid errors or directory finding issues. Only run the **page1.py** file, no need to run the other files, the other files automatically get executed when you run **page1.py**.

For the decoration and good User Interface, I used Flet. Flet is a framework of python.
In the .env file, you have to set the email address to your own gmail( you are the sender ). And in the password, you have to put the google app password, not the gmail password. To create the Google App Password, first enable 2 Factor Authentication on your Google Account and then create an App Password. Then copy that app password and put it in the password of the .env file

page1.py code: In this RECIPIENT_EMAIL = ""    , here you have to enter the email of the receiver(the person who will receive the email).

The data entered in the text fields is just random and doesnt do anything and doesnt get stored anywhere important. The focus is on the email sending logic.

And yes if a text file is automatically created in your folder, don't worry, it is part of the code, and the text file stores the OTP code.

The OTP is received in your gmail. Everything works.
